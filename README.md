MIDI Keyboard Trainer
=====================

Simple practice tool for training piano fingering strength.

Can be used as an example how to use [PortMidi](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/PortMidi)
(a Haskell binding for PortMedia/PortMidi)
and [uni-htk](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/uni-htk)
(GUI toolkit based on Tcl/Tk).

More examples of uni-htk use can be found at
